All code comments have to written in
[JavaDoc](https://www.oracle.com/ru/technical-resources/articles/java/javadoc-tool.html)
or
[Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/manual/docblocks.html)
style.

You have to comment code in these cases:
- Too logic overloaded method
- Too many arguments in functions and methods in your code (more than 5)
- If you use "bad practice" code
(you should write a comment message which have to contain this questions answers: where, why and what)
- You especially love writing documentation comments :)
- You use short variable name which don't contain clear meaning for what they be.
